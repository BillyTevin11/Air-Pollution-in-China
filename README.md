**<ins>Overview: Unmasking the Air – A Deep Dive into China’s Air Pollution Crisis</ins>**

Air pollution is more than just a hazy skyline — it’s a silent killer, claiming an estimated 7 million lives globally each year, with China alone accounting for nearly 2 million. This project explores one of the world’s most pressing environmental and public health challenges: Air Pollution in China’s major urban centers.

Despite rapid economic growth, industrial development, and technological advancement, China continues to grapple with the heavy cost of polluted air. From coal-fired power plants and vehicular emissions to industrial activities and household fuel use, a range of pollution sources have led to dangerously high levels of particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), carbon monoxide (CO) and more.

_But how bad is it — and where?_

To answer that, this project analyzed the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** across five of China’s most dynamic cities: _Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Chengdu_. These cities are not just economic powerhouses — they’re also hotspots of human activity and, unfortunately, air pollution.

Through the lens of AQI data, we uncover patterns, trends, and regional differences in air quality. For instance, Beijing, notorious for its winter smog, shows alarming seasonal spikes, while Shenzhen and Guangzhou present contrasting air quality profiles despite being part of the same industrial corridor.

But it’s not all grim. China has made notable strides in fighting back: adopting stricter emission laws, rolling out electric vehicles, and enhancing air quality monitoring systems. Still, the struggle to balance economic growth with sustainable development is ongoing.

This project doesn’t just present data — it tells the story of a nation caught in the crossroads of progress and pollution. It invites readers to explore what’s being done, what’s working, and what’s still at stake.

Whether you’re passionate about environmental justice, public health, urban planning, or sustainable policy, this deep dive into China’s air pollution is a call to breathe easier — through awareness, innovation, and action.
